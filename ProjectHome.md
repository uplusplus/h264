# Open Source H.264 Encoder Development Site #

[Adaptive Digital Technologies, Inc.](http://www.adaptivedigital.com) is pleased to release the source code for a baseline profile H.264 encoder.

Adaptive Digital's H.264 Baseline Profile (BP) encoder has been designed to support several toolsets to cater to the varying needs of the different applications it may be used in. Some of these include:

  * Is compliant with H.264 Baseline Profile (BP) up to level 3.
  * Supports YUV420 planar and YUV422i as raw video input formats.
  * Adheres to Constant Bit Rate (CBR) mode of rate control.
  * Supports run-time changes in the target bit-rate.
  * The source and target frame rates sent to the encoder are configurable. It further allows on the fly changes in both the source and the target frame rate.
  * Supports encoding of I picture on request.
  * Supports horizontal down-scaling by a factor of 2.
  * Configurable in-loop de-blocking filter, which can be turned on or off.
  * Supports Macroblock (MB) partitions sizes of 16x16, 16x8, 8x16 and 8x8.
  * Supports quarter-pixel accurate motion estimation in case of Inter MBs.
  * Configurable search-range to optimize internal memory.
